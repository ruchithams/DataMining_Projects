Online Retail Data Analysis

This repo contains Jupyter-Notebook that aims to clean the online retail data-set and
analyze the data by segmenting it, playing with dimensions, exploring the data further by
using PCA, Clustering and making useful predictions using Machine Learning Algorithm.

The code was executed using Python3. Following libraries are used in the analysis process:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. sklearn
